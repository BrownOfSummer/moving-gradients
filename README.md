moving-gradients
================

Implementation in Python of the 'Moving Gradients' image interpolation technique as described in http://people.csail.mit.edu/wojciech/MovingGradients/

The main part of the code is in gradients.py, though it needs Andreas Mueller's Python wrapper of GCO from https://github.com/amueller/gco_python
